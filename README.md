📊 Data Visualization Tool — Level 3 Task 2

This task introduces a basic interactive tool that generates different types of visualizations from a dataset using Python.
The goal is to build practical understanding of data visualization principles, using Matplotlib for clean and simple plotting.

🚀 Task Overview:

1)Load a dataset (CSV format)

2)Display available columns

3)Let the user choose:

a)Line Plot

b)Bar Chart

c)Scatter Plot

4)Ask the user which columns they want to plot

5)Render the figure using Matplotlib

🧠 How It Works:

1)The dataset is loaded using Pandas

2)The script prints all available column names

3)User selects the visualization type

4)User chooses X and Y columns

5)The program generates the plot and displays it

This keeps things intuitive and beginner-friendly while still showcasing interactive visualization.

📌 How to Run:

1)Install dependencies:

pip install pandas matplotlib

2)Place your CSV file as example.csv in the same folder

3)Run the script:

python data_visualizer.py

4)Choose the plot type and columns

🔍 Key Takeaways:

1)Hands-on experience with Matplotlib

2)Understanding of dataset structure

3)Flexibility to create multiple plot types

4)A foundation for advanced dashboarding (Seaborn, Plotly, etc.)
